# üü¢ 1. Basics (Syntax, Variables, Loops, Functions)

‚úÖ Goal: Get comfortable with fundamentals.

1. Write a function to check if a number is even or odd.  
2. Reverse a string without using built-in methods.  
3. Find the factorial of a number using recursion.  
4. Implement a function to count vowels in a string.  
5. Write a program to find the **largest element in an array**.  
6. FizzBuzz: Print numbers 1‚Äì100, replace multiples of 3 with ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù, 5 with ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù.  
7. Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.  
8. Write a function to flatten a nested array.  
9. Implement custom `Array.prototype.myForEach` and `Array.prototype.myMap`.

# üü° 2. Intermediate (Arrays, Objects, Functions)

‚úÖ Goal: Get good with data structures and functional programming.

10. Implement a function to remove duplicates from an array.  
11. Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.  
12. Group an array of objects by a key (like `age`).  
13. Find the first non-repeating character in a string.  
14. Implement your own `debounce(func, delay)` and `throttle(func, limit)`.  
15. Write a function that memoizes results (`memoize(fn)`).  
16. Implement currying: `sum(1)(2)(3)‚Ä¶()` ‚Üí returns total.  
17. Build a function that deep clones an object.  
18. Implement a custom `reduce` function.

# üü† 3. Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, async/await)

‚úÖ Goal: Master async flow & event loop.

19. Write a function that fetches JSON data from an API using `fetch`.  
20. Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.  
21. Implement `sleep(ms)` function with Promises.  
22. Run multiple promises with `Promise.all`, handle failures with `Promise.allSettled`.  
23. Implement a fake API that resolves after random time, and race it with `Promise.race`.  
24. Build a function that limits concurrent async operations (e.g., only 2 requests at a time).  
25. Write an async function that downloads data in chunks and merges them.  
26. Create your own **event emitter** (`on`, `emit`, `off`).

# üîµ 4. Advanced JavaScript Concepts

‚úÖ Goal: Work with closures, prototypes, classes, proxies.

27. Implement a counter using **closure**.  
28. Write your own `bind`, `call`, and `apply` functions.  
29. Build a publish-subscribe system (PubSub pattern).  
30. Implement function composition (`compose(f, g, h)` ‚Üí returns one function).  
31. Create a simple reactive state system (like Vue/React useState).  
32. Implement your own class-based inheritance system.  
33. Write a function that uses `Proxy` to log every property access of an object.  
34. Implement your own `new` operator (`myNew`).  
35. Write your own `instanceof` function.

# üî¥ 5. DOM & Browser Development

‚úÖ Goal: Build frontend features with JS only.

36. Build a **modal popup** with open/close functionality.  
37. Create a **todo list app** (add, delete, toggle complete).  
38. Build an **image slider/carousel**.  
39. Implement an **infinite scroll** that loads more items when reaching the bottom.  
40. Create a **debounced search box** that fetches from API as you type.  
41. Implement a **drag & drop** list reorder.  
42. Build a **custom context menu** on right click.  
43. Implement a **dark mode toggle** (save preference in localStorage).  
44. Build a **virtual keyboard** in pure JS.

# ‚ö´ 6. Super Advanced (Real-World / System Level)

‚úÖ Goal: Push your JS limits.

45. Build your own **Promise** class (polyfill).  
46. Implement your own **Event Loop simulation**.  
47. Write a **LRU Cache** in JS.  
48. Implement a **scheduler** that executes tasks with priority.  
49. Build your own **mini JavaScript bundler** (like Webpack) using Node.js.  
50. Create a **mini React** (support `createElement`, `render`, `useState`).  
51. Implement a **virtual DOM diffing algorithm**.  
52. Write a **function that observes object changes** (like Vue‚Äôs reactivity).  
53. Build a **real-time chat app** using WebSockets.  
54. Implement a **service worker** for offline caching.
